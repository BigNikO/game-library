      Field Hockey
    </h6>
    <p>
      Field hockey is a widely played team sport of the hockey family. The game can be played on grass, watered turf,artificial turf or synthetic field, as well as an indoor boarded surface. Each team plays with ten field players and a goal keeper. Players commonly use sticks made out of wood, carbon fibre, fibre glass or a combination of carbon fibre and fibre glass in different quantities (with the higher carbon fibre stick being more expensive and less likely to break) to hit a round, hard, plastic hockey ball. The length of the hockey stick is based on the player's individual height, the top of the stick usually comes to the players hip, taller players typically have taller sticks.
