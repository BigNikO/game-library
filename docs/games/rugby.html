      Rugby
    </h6>
    <p>
      Rugby league is a full-contact sport played by two teams of thirteen players on a rectangular field measuring 68 m wide and 112â€“122 m long. One of the two codes of rugby football, it originated in Northern England in 1895 as a split from the Rugby Football Union over the issue of payments to players. Its rules progressively changed with the aim of producing a faster, more entertaining game for spectators.
